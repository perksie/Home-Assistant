<h3 align="center">Trash Recycle Addon</h3>
<p align="center">
This is a great addon I use to help remind me of bin nights as I am terrible when it comes to this. Not only do I use this to remind me of bin nights but also for other reminders such as patch tuesdays for windows updates etc. </p><br>

I 3D printed this [Miniature bin](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4097960) out from thingiverse and use the RGB lights to light up a colour depending on the reminder.</p>
