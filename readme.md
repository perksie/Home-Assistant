This is my smart home. A continuous work in progress I'm sure you can all relate to. To Begin, the following methods of automation have been through a criterion of integration. This criterion is:</p>
<p align="center">
<b>
- Must have local control and not rely on cloud integration.<br>
- Must be family friendly</b><br></p>

<p align="center">Without meeting the criteria, it won't make it into household production.</p>

<p align="center">To further explain this criteria:<br></p>
<i>Must have local control</i><br>
<p>I'm sure most of us Home Assistant users can agree that relying on our devices to work on an internet connection can seem a bit daunting. Plus the added latency for a command to bounce around the world to change the light bulb you are sitting under seems a little silly don't you think?<br>
<b>Most importantly,</b> relying on someone/an organisation to hope that the code is secure enough really scares me. The publicity around unsecured IoT devices rings true. Please believe it.</p><br>
<i> Must be family friendly </i><br>
<p> I don't live alone. Home automation needs to better our lives at best by still remaining functional and speedy. I don't expect my family members to whip out their phones and open the app to turn the light on when there is a switch that does it way quicker with the same outcome. I try to look for ways to automate that process. For example, a motion sensor will turn the light on if after 5PM.</p> <br>
